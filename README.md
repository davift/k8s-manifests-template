# k8s-manifests-template

On the blog post https://dft.wiki/?p=3122 one may find a detailed explanation of the manifests and commands present in this repo.

The content of this repository is a small collection of templates for Kubernetes manifests.

It creates demo resources for `namespace`, `secret`, `pod`, `replicasets`, `service`, and `ingress`.

The script `deploy-all.sh` automates the deployment of all resources at once for testing the K8s platform or for learning purposes.
